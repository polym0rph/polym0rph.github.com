	<h2>About Me</h2>
</div>

<p>My name is Frederik Rudeck and I‘m a master student at the <a href="http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/">Hasso-Plattner-Institute</a> where I study IT-Systems Engineering. In 2007 I finished my Bachelor of Science in IT-Systems Engineering at the Hasso Plattner Institute. During my study I did an internship at <a href="http://www.sap.com/canada/">SAP Canada</a> in Montreal.</p>

<p>I‘m currently writing my master thesis and looking for work as an full time employee or intern. If you think that I can help you feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> and I can provide you with more detailed information about myself. Visit <a href="http://de.linkedin.com/pub/frederik-rudeck/28/ba8/429">my linkedin profile</a> to see my public résumé.</p>

<p>I‘m mainly working with C, C++ and C# right now but have experience with Python, Ruby, Flex and Javascript as well. Have a look at my <a href="/projects/">recent projects</a> or at my <a href="https://github.com/polym0rph">github page</a> to see what I am doing.<p>
