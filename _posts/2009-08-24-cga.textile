	<h3>About</h3>
</div>

"CGA - Call Graph Analyzer":http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/doellner/research/software_analysis_and_visualization.html is a software visualization infrastructure that is developed by the "computer graphics systems chair":http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/doellner/index.html of the "Hasso-Plattner-Institute":http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/. The Call Graph Analyzer obtains information from various fact extraction tools and provides an interactive graph visualization system. CGA addresses the following different software engineering tasks:

* Program understanding
* Debugging
* Performance analysis
* Quality Assurance

When CGA started, the intended operating system was Windows. The goal of this project was to port the whole CGA tool chain to Mac OS X and Linux systems.

With our implementation, we provide an alternative fact extraction tool chain based on common unix development tools like GCC and GDB. This extends CGA to be used to instrument a wider range of projects, because now it is possible to analyze systems which support the GCC compiler.
